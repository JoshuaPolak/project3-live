Christmas Sliding Puzzle Game
Project Overview

Because it is almost the season to be jolly, this project is a Christmas-themed sliding puzzle game where users compete to solve holiday-themed puzzles as quickly as possible. Players can scramble and rearrange puzzle tiles to reveal a complete image, track their time, and submit their score to a leaderboard to compete with others.

The game combines fun gameplay, festive visuals, animations, and competitive motivation through time-based scoring.
